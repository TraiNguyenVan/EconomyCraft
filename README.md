| Buttom            | Description                                                                                                              |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Shop**          | Buy and sell at fixed prices with unlimited stock. Left click buys, right click sells, shift-click uses the bulk amount. |
| **Auction House** | Buy items other players have listed, or list your own. Offline sellers receive a sale notice when they return.           |
| **Sell Items**    | Drop items in, check the total, confirm. Unpriced items can not be sold.                                                 |
| **Orders**        | Request an item, amount and price. Other players fill it and get paid.                                                   |
| **Daily Reward**  | Claims the daily payout, once per day.                                                                                   |
| **Pay a Player**  | Send money to another player.                                                                                            |
| **Leaderboards**  | Top Balances, Earners, Spenders, Sellers, Buyers and Traders.                                                            |
| **Item Value**    | The buy and sell price of any item.                                                                                      |
| **Deliveries**    | Items or payouts that couldn't be delivered directly (full inventory/completed while offline).                           |
| **Transactions**  | Your recent balance history.                                                                                             |
| **Tolls**         | Manage the block you are looking at within five blocks; its fee appears on the action bar. See [toll management](wiki/Tolls.md). |

Each screen also has a command: `/bal`, `/pay`, `/daily`, `/shop`, `/ah`, `/auction`, `/sell`, `/worth`, `/orders`, `/deliveries`, `/transactions`.

## The Admin (`/eco admin`) menu

### Shop editor

Browse categories and click an item to edit it.

- **Category editor**: right-click a category to rename it, change its color, icon or visibility, or exclude it from dynamic pricing. Deleting a category moves its items to `misc` and zeroes their buy prices.
- **Add item**: pick any item in the game, or one from your inventory. Custom names, enchantments and container contents are kept.
- **Buy Price / Sell Price**: the price of one item; `0` disables that direction. If dynamic pricing applies, this also shows the current price and multiplier.
- **Dynamic Pricing**: opt this item out of dynamic pricing even while it's enabled server-wide.
- **Bulk Amount**: how many a shift-click buys or sells.
- **Category**: which shop page the item appears on. `blocks.wood` creates a sub-page.
- **Delete**: removes the entry.

### Dynamic shop pricing

Optional, off by default (`dynamic_prices_enabled`). Scales every buy price by:

```
current price = base price × active-player median balance / starting balance
```

The scale is clamped between `dynamic_price_min_multiplier` and `dynamic_price_max_multiplier`, and recalculated at most once an hour. Sell prices are never affected. Opt out per category or item from the Shop editor above.

### Daily wealth tax

Optional, off by default (`wealth_tax_enabled`). Once per day, every balance above the floor pays a percentage of its surplus:

```
floor = max(wealth_tax_floor, active-player median balance x wealth_tax_median_floor_factor)
tax   = (balance - floor) x rate
```

Because the floor is a fraction of the median rather than a fixed number, it follows the economy: as rich balances pay down and the median drifts lower, the tax base shrinks on its own.

`wealth_tax_median_floor_factor` decides who is reached:

| Factor  | Floor        | Reaches                                    |
|---------|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `0.0`   | fixed        | everyone above the floor, including the poorest players |
| `0.5`   | half median  | the upper half                              |
| `1.0`   | the median   | only the top half, and the median can then never fall |

Players unseen for `wealth_tax_inactive_days` are charged `rate x wealth_tax_inactive_multiplier`, so the policy drains idle stock rather than taxing play.

The optional rebate (`wealth_tax_rebate_enabled`, off by default) is the injection side. It only arms when the median falls below `startingBalance x wealth_tax_rebate_trigger_factor` — the aggregate gate matters, because with a healthy median the floor sits above the poorest players, and a per-player test alone would pay out in a healthy economy.

Balances at or below the floor are never taxed, and a tax can never push a balance below the floor. Movement is recorded under `economycraft:wealth_tax` / `economycraft:wealth_rebate` and is deliberately excluded from the Leaderboards' earned/spent totals, since it is neither income nor spending.

### Settings

Every option in `config.json`, editable in-game.

### Players

Select any player, online or not, to give, take or set their balance, clear their Leaderboard stats, remove them from the economy, or override their max active orders/auctions.

### Reset Tools


| Tool                        | Does                                                                                        |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Reset All Balances**      | Sets every player's balance back to `startingBalance`.                                      |
| **Reset Daily Reward Data** | Everyone can claim their daily reward again immediately.                                    |
| **Reset Daily Sell Limits** | Everyone's daily sell limit resets to full immediately.                                     |
| **Clear Auctions**          | Cancels every active listing. Items are returned to sellers' deliveries.                    |
| **Clear Orders**            | Cancels every open order. Escrowed money is refunded to requesters.                         |
| **Run Wealth Tax Now**      | Applies the daily wealth tax immediately and reports what it took, per day.                |
| **Reset Entire Economy**    | All of the above, plus wipes the Leaderboards stats and deletes the entire transaction log. |

None of these touch shop prices/categories or permission settings. **Run Wealth Tax Now** is the one tool that moves real balances as a side effect; it does nothing while `wealth_tax_enabled` is off.

### Admin commands

`/eco addmoney`, `/eco setmoney`, `/eco removemoney`, `/eco removeplayer`.

## Permissions

Admin and command access is gated by permission nodes. Any admin node not set by a permission plugin falls back to OP; any command node not set falls back to allowed for everyone.

| `wealth_tax_rebate_max_rate`     | `0.01`  | Rebate rate applied to the shortfall below the floor.                                                            |

### `webhook.json`

| Key                  | Default | Description                                            |
|----------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `webhook_enabled`    | `false` | Post transactions to `webhook_url`.                    |
| `webhook_url`        | `""`    | Discord-compatible incoming webhook URL.               |
| `webhook_min_amount` | `0`     | Skip webhook posts for transactions smaller than this. |

### `prices.json`

One entry per shop item, keyed by item id:

```json
{
  "minecraft:diamond": {
    "category": "ores",
    "stack": 64,
    "unit_buy": 800,
    "unit_sell": 200
  }
}
```

`category` accepts `top.sub` for a sub-page, `stack` is the shift-click bulk amount, and `unit_buy`/`unit_sell` are the price of one item (`0` disables that direction). Items from installed mods are added automatically, using their mod ID as category and `0` for both prices.

The editor also writes a few extra keys:

- `components`: NBT for custom items (name, enchantments, container contents). A `#label` suffix distinguishes duplicates of the same item, e.g. `minecraft:shulker_box#loot_rare`.
- `"removed": true`: marks a deleted default so it isn't restored on the next start. Delete the entry to restore it.
- `"dynamic_price_enabled": false`: opts an item, or a category under `_categories`, out of dynamic pricing.

## Placeholders

Exposes economy data to other mods via [Text Placeholder API](https://modrinth.com/mod/placeholder-api) (Fabric) or [Placeholder API NeoForge](https://modrinth.com/mod/placeholder-api-neoforge) (NeoForge). Both are optional, the mod works without them, but the matching jar must be in `mods/` for placeholders to resolve.

| `%economycraft:top_balance <rank>%`           | Raw balance at that rank.                                                |
| `%economycraft:top_balance_formatted <rank>%` | Formatted balance at that rank.                                          |

## Transaction logs and webhook

Every balance change is logged to `logs/transactions-YYYY-MM-DD.log` inside the config folder, and kept for `transaction_log_retention_days` days (default `7`). Setting it above 90 logs a console warning on start.

Enable `webhook_enabled` in `webhook.json` to also POST each transaction to a Discord-compatible webhook; use `webhook_min_amount` to only notify on larger transactions.

## Developer API

The normal EconomyCraft jar includes API v1 for other server-side mods, no separate runtime API mod to install. Covers balances and payments, money formatting, read-only item prices, leaderboard data and balance-change events. Public classes are under `com.reazip.economycraft.api.v1`.

See the [Developer API wiki](https://github.com/PhilipB06/EconomyCraft/wiki) for setup, examples and the complete reference.
